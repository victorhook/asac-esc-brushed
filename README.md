# **A** **S**imple **A**nd **C**ool brushed ESC
Why do cool fpv drones pretty much always use brushless motors? Well, because they are really good. BUT, they are quite expensive, and brushless ESCs are also quite expensive, since they require somewhat complex hardware and firmware. Thus, this project aims to make a simple and cool ESC that can be used for drones with *brushed* motors. Let's see how this goes!
